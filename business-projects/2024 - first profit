# Crypto Market Analysis & Micro-Investment — Bitcoin and US Elections 2024

**Goal:**  
To explore how major political events affect cryptocurrency volatility and to test a real micro-investment strategy based on market sentiment.

**Background:**  
In late October 2024, one week before the **US Presidential Elections**, I decided to allocate **£700 (≈ $910)** as a small personal investment in **Bitcoin (BTC)**.  
The rationale was that large political events—especially elections—tend to trigger strong market reactions.  
Public statements from candidate **Donald Trump**, who had openly supported Bitcoin, created a bullish narrative that I expected to move the market upward.

**Process & Tools:**  
- Collected historic BTC data during previous election cycles (2016 → 2020 → 2024).  
- Used **CoinMarketCap**, **TradingView** and **Google Sheets** to track hourly price changes.  
- Analysed correlation between media coverage, search trends, and BTC volatility.  
- Calculated average return, ROI %, and moving averages.

**Investment Details:**  
- **Entry price:** ≈ $73 000 per BTC (1 week before elections)  
- **Exit price (post-election peak):** ≈ $90 000 per BTC  
- **Growth:** ≈ 23 % within ~10 days  
- **Position size:** 0.0125 BTC  
- **Final value:** ≈ $1 122 (≈ £863)  
- **Profit:** ≈ $212 (≈ £163)

**Result:**  
- Short-term ROI ≈ **+23 %**.  
- Confirmed that **political narratives can act as catalysts** for short-term speculative price surges.  
- Reinforced the value of combining data analytics with behavioural and news-driven insights.

**Reflection:**  
This experiment provided my **first earned seed capital**, demonstrating that analytical reasoning can yield measurable financial outcomes.  
The profit became the foundation for my next business project — an **e-commerce reselling venture** launched in 2025.
